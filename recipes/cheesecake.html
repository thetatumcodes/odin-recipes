<h4>Japanese Cheesecake adapted from Joanne Chang of Boston’s Flour Bakery</h4>
<p>Japanese cheesecakes, sometimes called soufflé or cotton cheesecakes, have a melt-in-the-mouth texture 
    that’s like a classic cheesecake crossed with an ethereal sponge cake.Yum! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
       <li>3 tablespoons/45 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing</li>
       <li>5 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
       <li>1 cup/225 grams cream cheese</li>
       <li>½ cup/120 grams crème fraîche</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
       <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
       <li>½ cup/100 grams plus 1 tablespoon superfine sugar</li>
       <li>½ cup/65 grams cake flour</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon confectioners’ sugar, for garnish
       </li>
       <li>zest and juice of 1 lemon</li>
   </ul>
<h2> Steps</h2>
       <ol>
           <li>Place rack in the center of the oven and heat to 400 degrees. Line bottom of an 
               8-by-3-inch round cake pan with parchment paper and butter only the bottom of the
                pan (so the cheesecake can rise). You can also use a springform pan; just wrap the
                 bottom and sides with a double layer of foil, so the seams are covered.</li>
            <li>Separate eggs. Place whites in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment; 
                     place yolks in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Place cream cheese in a large metal bowl or double boiler insert and place over a pot 
                filled with 1 inch of simmering water. Stir until cream cheese is melted and smooth. 
                Whisk in crème fraîche and 3 tablespoons butter until well combined and smooth. Remove 
                from heat and whisk in lemon zest, vanilla and salt. Whisk in egg yolks and 3 
                tablespoons/40 grams superfine sugar. Sprinkle cake flour evenly over the top, 
                then whisk it in.</li>
            <li>Beat the egg whites on medium speed until you start to see the wires of the whisk leave
                 a trail in the whites. Slowly add the remaining 6 tablespoons superfine sugar, a tablespoon 
                 at a time while beating. Continue to beat until whites are fluffy and hold a soft peak when 
                 beaters are lifted. Gently fold about one-quarter of the whites into the yolk mixture 
                 to lighten it. Then gently fold in remaining whites, taking care not to deflate batter. 
                 Pour into prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Place cake pan in a roasting pan or other pan that is at least as deep as the cake pan; 
                transfer to the oven. Fill the larger pan with enough hot tap water to come one-quarter 
                of the way up the sides of the cake pan. (The cake is really light, so if you pour in too
                 much water it may float.)</li>
            <li>Bake until top of the cake is golden and doesn’t give when you press it gently in the middle,
                 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off oven and crack the oven door so that it cools off. Leave cheesecake in the cooling-off 
                oven for 2 hours so it cools slowly, which keeps the top from cracking.</li>
            <li>Lift cheesecake pan out of water and place on a wire rack. Let cool for another 2 hours. 
                Cheesecake will deflate slightly.
            </li>
            <li>Run a knife around the edges of the cheesecake to loosen it from sides of pan. 
                Remove sides of springform pan. If you used a regular cake pan, invert the cake 
                onto a plate, lift off pan, peel off parchment, then invert it right side up on 
                a serving plate.</li>
            <li>Chill cake for at least 2 hours before serving. Cake can be stored, well wrapped, for up 
                to 4 days in the refrigerator. Sift confectioners’ sugar over top of cake just 
                before serving.</li>
       </ol>
   </ul>
