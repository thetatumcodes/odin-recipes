<h4>Delicious Japanese Fried Chicken- Super Easy to Make!</h4>
<p>This Japanese Fried Chicken is very easy to make and your guests will love it! It can be served as an appetizer, or over a bed of rice as a quick weekday 
    dinner. You can marinate the night before to give it more flavor, but if it's a last-minute meal you are preparing, no worries, 
    because there's still dipping sauce! Serve hot with shredded lettuce and a lemon wedge.</p>
